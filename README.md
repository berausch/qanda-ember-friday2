#_Brittany Rausch - Question and Answer Message Board Part2_

#### _JS-Ember Exercise for Epicodus, 08.26.2016_

#### By _**Brittany Rausch**_

## Description

_{This is an ember exercise made for Epicodus that takes user Questions (along with author, and note information), and allows users to click on that question and be taken to a separate page where they can add answers. There is also the capability to update or delete question content as well as delete answers. There are symbols (made using helpers) that say whether a question is popular or doesn't have any answers. Once a user is on the question page the answers are sorted by most upvotes. A user can upvote by clicking the upvote button, which increases the number of votes.  They can also favorite questions or answers by clicking the star next to them, and they will then show up on the favorite page (for which there is a link in the navbar). }_
